I designed this bracket to fit to a standard camera tripod and clamp almost anything up to 40mm round. It works reasonably well on irregular sized objects like the webcam in the picture. 

It uses standard M5 nuts and bolts, the nuts are hidden inside the ring. It should be fairly intuitive to assemble.

I placed a break in the main ring to try and reduce any excess pressure that might be placed on whatever is being clamped. Regardless, use at own risk.

## Additional items
* 1x 1/4-20 UNC nut
* 3x M5 nuts
* 3x M5 50mm long bolts 

## Printing Notes
* At least 0.2 mm layer height
* Recommended at 100% infill
* Self supporting
